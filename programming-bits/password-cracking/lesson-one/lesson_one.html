                    <p> 
                        You might have heard the story of <a href="">Nate Anderson</a>:br the journalist who cracked 8000 passwords in 24 hours without substantial expertise. 
                        Naturally, people wondered how was such a feat possible. Belive it or not, password cracking is eased by tools such as <a href="">Hashcat</a>. 
                        However, the journey you must take to become a password cracker can be lowered down to 2 hours or less using the tips that took me over two hours to figure out.

                    <p>Questions to answer:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect the ls
                            passwords?</li>
                        <li>What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?</li>
                        <li>What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?</li>
                        <li> What can you tell about the organizationâ€™s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)?</li>
                        <li> What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder? </li>
                    </ul>
